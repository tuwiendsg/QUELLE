<a name="abstract" class="anchor" href="#abstract"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract</h3>

<p> A large number of cloud providers offer diverse types of cloud
services for constructing complex
"cloud-native" software. However, there is a lack of supporting tools
and mechanisms for accelerating the development of cloud-native software-defined elastic
systems (SES) based on elasticity capabilities of cloud
services. In this paper we
introduce QUELLE -- a framework for evaluating and recommending SES
deployment configurations. QUELLE presents models for describing the elasticity capabilities of cloud
services and capturing elasticity requirements of SESs. Based on that
QUELLE introduces novel functions and algorithms for
quantifying the elasticity capabilities of cloud services.  QUELLE's
algorithms can recommend SES deployment configurations from
cloud services that both provide the required elasticity, and
fulfill cost, quality, and resource requirements, and thus can be
incorporated into different phases of the development of SESs. We
present several experiments based on real-world cloud services for the
development of an elastic machine-to-machine data-as-a-service system. </p>

<p>
To develop cloud native elastic systems, in current approaches, the developer has to manually investigate all cloud services offered by various cloud providers, and evaluate if their elasticity capabilities provide the required elasticity control options. Then, s/he can use existing design and modeling tools such as <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45005-1_64" >Winery</a> to design and deploy the DaaS on cloud infrastructures. Manually selecting each cloud service needed for constructing the DaaS is laborious, complex, and error prone. These problems can be reduced and the development can be accelerated if we could provide features, shown in the above figure for: 
<ul>
<li> capturing and modeling elasticity capabilities of cloud services from different ecosystems and multi-level SES requirements (indicated by 1) </li> 
<li> providing  service elasticity quantification functions  for software development tools (indicated by 2)  </li> 
<li> recommending SES configurations, which can later on be mapped to software-interpretable deployment descriptor (indicated by 3)   </li> 
</ul>

			<p> In the following we briefly describe the current QUELLE prototype.  For managing the Cloud Services Model, we implemented a graph-based <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> Cloud Services Persistence Adapter. The population of the cloud services repository should ideally be an automatic process, with the increase in cloud providers' description APIs. However, currently we rely on available JSON description services and HTML parsing to populate our model. For SES configurations visualization, we have implemented a <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tosc">TOSCA</a>-based output formatter for <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45005-1_64" >Winery</a> </i>

<p>For explaining the concept of <b> Elasticity Dependency </b>, let's focus on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" >Amazon EC2</a> m3.xlarge service unit, and model its elasticity it capabilities. The above figure shows the elasticity capabilities offered by this service: one mandatory association to another service unit which decreases the elasticity (left part of the figure), one optional association to a StorageQuality and StorageQuality Cost, and 8 Cost possibilities. To further understand the elasticity of the service unit, we must focus on each individual Elasticity Capabilities. For example, focusing on the Storage Elasticity Capabilities we discover that it provides another two Elasticity Capabilities targeting Storage Quality.</p>

  For managing the cloud services description model introduced in the paper, we define 7 Neo4J graph node types: <i> Service</i>, <i> Resource</i>, <i> Quality</i>, <i> Cost</i>, <i> CostFunction</i>, and <i> ElasticityCapability</i>. We also define several types of entity relationships for expressing express dependencies between entities: <i> hasResource</i>, <i> hasQuality</i>, <i> hasCost</i>, <i> hasCostFunction</i>, <i> hasElasticityCapability</i>, and <i> elasticityCapabilityFor</i>. Graph nodes capture information for categorizing the type of stored entity, and not particular property values; the actual values are captured as relationships properties. For example, two <i>  Service</i> entities could target the same <i> CPU Resource</i> node, and have on their respective <i> hasResource</i> relationships the different CPU properties. This enables selecting services with specific elasticity capabilities, and then analyzing their capabilities properties from their respective relationships.

<a name="experiments1" class="anchor" href="#experiments1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quantifying Elasticity of Amazon EC2 IaaS Services</h3>
<p>
As the meaning of elasticity might vary depending on the stakeholder, QUELLE provides a customizable elasticity quantification function relying on user-defined<b> VolatilityQ</b>,<b> ElDepQ</b>, and<b> ElPhaseQ</b> coefficients. As the user is interested in building an elastic system, s/he expects services to be allocated/deallocated often. As Amazon bills its services minimum on a hourly basis, the supplied volatility quantification coefficient is <b>VolatilityQ =</b> <b> 1/minLifetime (Hours)</b>, generating a volatility of 1 for hourly reserved services, and 1 / (365 * 24) for yearly reserved services. As the user wants to use services which have as few dependencies on other services, s/he supplies an elasticity dependency quantification coefficient<b> ElDepQ = 1 if Optional-Association,  and -1 if Mandatory-Association</b>. Finally, the supplied elasticity phase quantification coefficient is<b> ElPhaseQ = 0.33 if Instantiation-Time, 0.67 if Run-Time, 1 if Both</b>, and all elasticity dimensions have same weight coefficient<b> W_d=1</b>.  
</p>
<p>
The result of quantifying the elasticity of Amazon EC2 services over cost, quality, resources, and services associations is depicted in the below figure. As the defined<b> VolatilityQ</b> function quantifies close to zero all options of reserving a service for 1 or 3 years, the cost elasticity of most services, such as <b> m3.large</b> is quantified close to 2. Amazon EC2 services which have optional dependencies have additional cost and quality control options. Thus, Amazon EC2 IaaS services with  can be associated with an<b> EBS</b> service have their service association elasticity quantified to<b> >= 1</b>, and cost elasticity quantified to <b> <= 3</b>.

<h3>
<a name="experiments2" class="anchor" href="#experiments2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recommending SES Configurations</h3>
<p> We aim to accelerate the development of SESs by recommending deployment configurations using cloud services providing the required elasticity for its units. Thus, we define a four phase recommendation process: (i) processing SES requirements, (ii) quantifying elasticity of cloud services, (iii) recommending elasticity-driven SES configurations, and (iv) exporting SES configurations as cloud deployment descriptor.
</p>
 
<p> Mixed SES requirements w.r.t. cost, resource and quality,  are described by the user in a top-down fashion, from the entire SES to individual units. At the  <i> SES </i> level, a requirement for a Management as a Service (MaaS) cloud services with a monitoring frequency of 5 minutes is specified, which will be applied to all SES's units. As the units belonging to the  <i> Event Processing Topology </i> level perform sensitive computation, a MaaS requirement for a monitoring cloud services providing a monitoring frequency of 1 minute is specified, overriding the SES level requirement. The  <i> Event Processing Unit </i> requires an IaaS cloud services with over 2 CPU cores and 5 GB of RAM, and a Moderate network performance. In turn, the  <i> Messaging Unit </i> requires a PaaS service of type messaging. Similarly, the  <i> Data End Unit </i> requires an IaaS cloud services providing at least 10 GB of RAM, I/O Performance of at least 1000 IOps together with at least a Moderate network performance.

The requirements XML can be downloaded from <a href="./images/requirements.xml"> here </a>
<center><a href="images/requirements.png?[modal]=true" data-lightbox="mypic"><img src="images/requirements.png" alt="Multi-level SES requirements"   ></a></center>
</p>

 
<p>  Processing all IaaS, PaaS, and MaaS requirements refined above, our prototype generates a TOSCA  descriptor containing the recommended SES configuration. For the <i> Event Processing Topology </i>, the recommendation is visualized in the figure below using Winery, a TOSCA modeling and visualization tool. The recommendation contains an <i> m1.large </i> IaaS service fulfilling the resource and network performance quality requirements with associated <i> SpotCost </i>, due the <i> Minimum Cost </i> strategy. A PaaS <i> Monitoring Service </i> with a <i> High Monitoring Frequency </i> is recommended for the monitoring frequency requirement, and a MaaS <i> SimpleQueue </i> service for the message oriented middleware requirements.

</p>

<p>
In a similar fashion, recommendations are provided for the <i> Data End Topology </i>,  containing an <i> m1.xlarge </i> IaaS cloud service, an <i> Elastic Block Store (EBS) </i> IaaS cloud service, with <i> IOps 4000 </i> fulfilling the I/O quality requirement, and a PaaS <i> Monitoring Service </i> at 5 minutes frequency, fulfilling the SES level monitoring requirement.
